# jigsaw

1. Now i needed to run a kaggle notebook when the git repo commits the jigsaw data
2. Maybe we can train a model and wait until we get a weights 
3. We needed the dependencies to download after the jigsaw update
4. Once we get the weights then we can run an inference notebook and submit those
5.
